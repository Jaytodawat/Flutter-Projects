*To hide the banner shown as Debug Mode, do following in MaterialApp() widget
    debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false

*SafeArea() is a widget use to add padding
    -if your app’s widgets are overlaying any of the system’s features like notches, status bar,
     camera holes, or any other such features, then SafeArea would add padding around the app,
     as required.


*Container is single child widget
    - Containers with no children try to be as big as possible
    - Containers with children size themselves to their children

    1.margins is done for aligning container widget
        margins: EdgeInsets.<fun>
    2.padding is done for aligning the child widget inside the container
        padding: EdgeInsets.<fun>


*For adding multiple children, column & rows are used.
    Column(children: [Container(), Container(), ...,]

    -When column is created, it takes up the all the space below the container() widget
     to shrink up the column to size of all children, do following
        mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min

    -verticalDirection: VerticalDirection.up => from bottom to up
    -verticalDirection: VerticalDirection.down => default

    mainAxisAlignment : MainAxisAlignment.<fun> => for aligning the widgets inside the
                                                   column in vertical axis

    crossAxisAlignment : CrossAxisAlignment.<fun> => for aligning the widgets inside the
                                                     column in horizontal axis

    -width : double.infinity => widget expand to width of screen size

    *SizedBox() widget is used to add spacing between two container/ widget


* style: TextStyle() => used for styling text inside Text() widget
    Text(
        'text',
        style: TextStyle(
            fontFamily: <fontfamily>,
            fontSize: ,
            fontWeight:<boldness>,
            color: ,
        ),
    )

* Card() is like a Container() widget, but it has rounded corners and shadow effect
- Card doesn't have padding property
- Hence we use Padding() class as parent of Card() class

*ListTile() is widget to add leading or trailing icon with text and subtitle in Card or Row as a child widget
    - ListTile(
        leading: <leading icon>,
        title: <text to be added using Text(),
        subtitle: <text to be added below the title>,
        trailing: <icon after title>,
     )

*Divider() => A thin horizontal line, with padding on either side.



*Expanded() => Expands the child of Row, Column in available space in mainAxis.
               -If multiple children are expanded, the available space is divided among them
                according to the flex factor.
